Drinking Fountain Reviewer
===============

Website designed for reviewing and viewing reviews for the water fountains at U32 Middle & High School
Very soon it will be pulling data from a google form to automatically fill reviews and calculate star ratings!

Demo
---------------

The website is live here:
https://fountain.burningbutter.com/

How to run your own review site (unfinished)
---------------

- Create a Google Form and link it to Google Sheets (creating a Google Form on a school/work account allows you to restrict access to only people in your school district or workspace)
- Navigate to the Google Sheet and go to `File > Share > Publish to Web` and change "Web Page" to "Comma-Separated Values (.csv)". Hit publish and copy the link.
- Use [papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/) to convert the CSV data to JSON directly in your website's Javascript.

More specifics on how to use this repo coming soon
